## Key contributions

* Curriculum is designed to provide both breadth and depth in computer science,
* while allowing for flexibility of specific upper-level course offerings to 
allow faculty to design new courses and adapt to specialties of new and
visiting faculty.

Our introductory sequence consists of 3 courses:  Introduction to Computer
Science (CS21); Data Structures and Algorithms(35); and Introduction to
Computer Systems(CS31).   All of our upper-level courses are grouped into
three groups: Theory and Algorithms; Systems; and Applications.  We ensure
breath in our major, by requiring all majors to take at least one course
from each group.  Additionally, majors have upper-level elective requirements
that provides an means for students to explore specific areas of interest in
more depth.   

In the past our curriculum included a senior seminar capstone requirement
for the major.  It was run
like a graduate-level seminar where students read and discuss research
papers, and propose and carry out a semester long project.  Unfortunately,
we have had to cut this from our curriculum due to enrollment issues.

* Student Mentor Program in our three introductory courses.  Our 
  [CS Ninja](https://www.swarthmore.edu/computer-science/ninjas) program
was designed, in part, to improve retention and recruitment of underrepresented
students, and to provide a more helpful, welcoming and supportive environment
for our introductory students. Student ninjas are selected from students who
recently completed the course based on ..  
We have seen a dramatic improvement in representation in our courses and our
major.  Currently, we meet the college-wide demographics for URM and women 
in our intro course, and close in our second two courses.  
And approximately 40% of our majors are women (the class of 2020 is 42%).

* Introduce parallel computing in our introductory course sequence. 
  One of our second courses, CS31, introduces shared memory parallel computing
  with pthreads, including syncrhonization.  This has been ...
  All of our Systems Group courses include some coverage of PDC, so every 
major has exposure to PDC at the introductory and advanced level through their 
group requirment.
