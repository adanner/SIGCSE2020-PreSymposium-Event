become proficient programmers
* Demonstrate an understanding of the interplay between theory and practice
demonstrate adequate competency in theory, systems, and applications, the three main areas of the computer science curriculum.
* Have a broad exposure to computer systems.
* Have experience conducting research and completing large projects; often such projects will require a team effort.
* Be able to apply the computational and algorithmic problem solving skills learned in computer science across many disciplines.

available on our website.

### Major program(s)

The following are the requirements for a major in computer science:

Eight credits in computer science:
* CPSC 021: Introduction to Computer Science
* CPSC 031: Introduction to Computer Systems and CPSC 035: Data Structures and Algorithms
* One course from each of the following three groups:
  - Theory Group : CPSC 041: Algorithms or CPSC 046: Theory of Computation
  - Systems Group 2: CPSC 043: Computer Networks, CPSC 044: Database Systems, CPSC 045: Operating Systems, CPSC 075: Compilers, CPSC 087: Parallel and Distributed Computing, or CPSC 089: Cloud Systems and Data Center Networks.
  - Applications Group 3: CPSC 040: Computer Graphics, CPSC 056: Computer Animation, CPSC 063: Artificial Intelligence, CPSC 065: Natural Language Processing, CPSC 066: Machine Learning, CPSC 068: Bioinformatics, CPSC 071: Software Engineering, CPSC 073: Programming Languages or CPSC 081: Adaptive Robotics
* Two CPSC courses numbered above CPSC 035: Data Structures and Algorithms that are different than the choices above.  
* The senior comprehensive, â€‹CPSC 099.
* Two credits in MATH at the level of MATH 027: Discrete Math or above. Discrete Math and Linear Algebra are recommended. Students may satisfy one of these requirements with STAT 021: Statistical Methods II.

Acceptance Criteria

To be eligible for a computer science major, a student must have at least a C+ average in the intermediate courses (CPSC 031 and CPSC 035). In addition, students must have at least a C in CPSC 031 and CPSC 035. Students who have not met this criterion may re-take CPSC 031 or CPSC 035 to obtain the necessary foundation for success in upper-level courses.

### Non-major program(s)

The following are the requirements for a minor in computer science:

Six credits in computer science (see above for course names):

* CPSC 021.
* CPSC 031 and CPSC 035.
* Two upper-level courses drawn from two of the following three groups:
  - Theory Group: CPSC 041 or CPSC 046.
  - Systems Group: CPSC 043, CPSC 044, CPSC 045, CPSC 075, CPSC 087 or CPSC 089 .
  - Applications Group: CPSC 040, CPSC 056, CPSC 063, CPSC 065, CPSC 066, CPSC 068, CPSC 071, CPSC 073 or CPSC 081.

* One CPSC course numbered above CPSC 035 that is different from the choices above.
* One MATH course at the level of MATH 027 or above. Discrete Math is recommended. Students may satisfy this requirement with STAT 021.


## Key contributions

1. **Curriculum is designed to provide both breadth and depth in computer science**, while allowing for flexibility of specific upper-level course offerings to allow faculty to design new courses and adapt to specialties of new and
visiting faculty.
Our introductory sequence consists of 3 courses:  Introduction to Computer
Science (CS21); Data Structures and Algorithms(35); and Introduction to
Computer Systems(CS31).   All of our upper-level courses are grouped into
three groups: Theory and Algorithms; Systems; and Applications.  We ensure
breath in our major, by requiring all majors to take at least one course
from each group.  Additionally, majors have upper-level elective requirements
that provides an means for students to explore specific areas of interest in
more depth.   The figure below shows the design and prerequisite structure of
our curriculum.

2. **Student Mentor Program in our three introductory courses**.  Our
  [CS Ninja](https://www.swarthmore.edu/computer-science/ninjas) program
was designed, in part, to improve retention and recruitment of underrepresented
students, and to provide a more helpful, welcoming and supportive environment
for our introductory students. Student ninjas are selected from students who
recently completed the course.  We choose ninjas who did well in the course,
but who are also patient, responsible, enthusiastic, and helpful to students with all backrounds and abilities.  We addtionally, select a diverse set of
student ninjas because of their importance as mentors.  We have seen a
dramatic improvement in representation in our courses and our major.  
Currently, we meet the college-wide demographics for URM and women
in our intro course, and close in our second two courses.  
And approximately 40% of our majors are women (the class of 2020 is 42%).

3. **Introduce parallel computing in our introductory course sequence**.
  One of our second courses, CS31, introduces shared memory parallel computing
  with pthreads, including synchronization.  CS31 also adds important
  background in systems, machine orgainizaiton, and C programming that
  is a prerequisite to our upper-level Systems Group courses.  
  All of our Systems Group courses include some coverage of parallel and
  distributed computing (PDC) topics, ensuring that every major has
  exposure to PDC at the introductory and advanced level through their
  group requirement.  The addtion
  of a CS31 prerequisite has freed up time in our upper-level courses
  where we used to introduce some of its content, and allowed us to expand
  coverage of PDC topics in these courses (the starred courses in our
  curriculum figure include PDC topics).  Details about the PDC parts of
  our curriculum are in our [2017 Journal of Parallel and Distributed
  Computing paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731517300114).  CS31, Introdcution to Computer Systems provides
