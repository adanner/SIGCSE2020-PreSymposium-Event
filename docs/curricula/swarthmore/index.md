### Major program(s)

The following are the requirements for a major in computer science:

Eight credits in computer science:
* CPSC 021: Introduction to Computer Science
* CPSC 031: Introduction to Computer Systems and CPSC 035: Data Structures and Algorithms
* One course from each of the following three groups:
 - Group 1: CPSC 041: Algorithms or CPSC 046: Theory of Computation
 - Group 2: CPSC 043: Computer Networks, CPSC 044: Database Systems, CPSC 045: Operating Systems, CPSC 075: Compilers, CPSC 087: Parallel and Distributed Computing, or CPSC 089: Cloud Systems and Data Center Networks.
 - Group 3: CPSC 040: Computer Graphics, CPSC 056: Computer Animation, CPSC 063: Artificial Intelligence, CPSC 065: Natural Language Processing, CPSC 066: Machine Learning, CPSC 068: Bioinformatics, CPSC 071: Software Engineering, CPSC 073: Programming Languages or CPSC 081: Adaptive Robotics
* Two CPSC courses numbered above CPSC 035: Data Structures and Algorithms that are different than the choices in part (c) above. Excludes courses that earn less than 1 credit.  
* The senior comprehensive, â€‹CPSC 099.
* Two credits in MATH at the level of MATH 027: Discrete Math or above. Discrete Math and Linear Algebra are recommended. Students may satisfy one of these requirements with STAT 021: Statistical Methods II. 

Acceptance Criteria

To be eligible for a computer science major, a student must have at least a C+ average in the intermediate courses (CPSC 031 and CPSC 035). In addition, students must have at least a C in CPSC 031 and CPSC 035. Students who have not met this criterion may re-take CPSC 031 or CPSC 035 to obtain the necessary foundation for success in upper-level courses.

### Non-major program(s)

The following are the requirements for a minor in computer science:

Six credits in computer science (see above for course names):

* CPSC 021.
* CPSC 031 and CPSC 035.
* Two upper-level courses drawn from two of the following three groups:
  - Group 1: CPSC 041 or CPSC 046.
  - Group 2: CPSC 043, CPSC 044, CPSC 045, CPSC 075, CPSC 087 or CPSC 089 .
  - Group 3: CPSC 040, CPSC 056, CPSC 063, CPSC 065, CPSC 066, CPSC 068, CPSC 071, CPSC 073 or CPSC 081.

* One CPSC course numbered above CPSC 035 that is different from the choices in part (c) above. Excludes courses that earn less than 1 credit.
* One MATH course at the level of MATH 027 or above. Discrete Math is recommended. Students may satisfy this requirement with STAT 021.
