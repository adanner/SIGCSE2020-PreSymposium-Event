### Major program(s)

The following are the requirements for a major in computer science:

Eight credits in computer science:
* CPSC 021. (If exempted from CPSC 021 without AP credit, substitute one course from any Group listed below.)
CPSC 031 and CPSC 035.
* One course from each of the following three groups:
 - Group 1: CPSC 041 or CPSC 046.
 - Group 2: CPSC 043, CPSC 044, CPSC 045, CPSC 075 , CPSC 087 or CPSC 089 .
 - Group 3: CPSC 040, CPSC 056, CPSC 063, CPSC 065, CPSC 066, CPSC 068, CPSC 071, CPSC 073 or CPSC 081.
* Two CPSC courses numbered above CPSC 035 that are different than the choices in part (c) above. Excludes courses that earn less than 1 credit.  
* The senior comprehensive, â€‹CPSC 099.
* Two credits in MATH at the level of MATH 027 or above. Discrete Math and Linear Algebra are recommended. Students may satisfy one of these requirements with STAT 021. Students who place out of one or both of these two credits should contact the Computer Science department chair. Note that CPSC 046 /MATH 046 may not be used to satisfy the Math requirement.

Acceptance Criteria

To be eligible for a computer science major, a student must have at least a C+ average in the intermediate courses (CPSC 031 and CPSC 035). In addition, students must have at least a C in CPSC 031 and CPSC 035. Students who have not met this criterion may re-take CPSC 031 or CPSC 035 to obtain the necessary foundation for success in upper-level courses.

### Non-major program(s)

The following are the requirements for a minor in computer science:

Six credits in computer science:

* CPSC 021. (If exempted from CPSC 021 without AP credit, substitute one course from any Group listed below.)
* CPSC 031 and CPSC 035.
* Two upper-level courses drawn from two of the following three groups:
  - Group 1: CPSC 041 or CPSC 046.
  - Group 2: CPSC 043, CPSC 044, CPSC 045, CPSC 075, CPSC 087 or CPSC 089 .
  - Group 3: CPSC 040, CPSC 056, CPSC 063, CPSC 065, CPSC 066, CPSC 068, CPSC 071, CPSC 073 or CPSC 081.

* One CPSC course numbered above CPSC 035 that is different from the choices in part (c) above. Excludes courses that earn less than 1 credit.
* One MATH course at the level of MATH 027 or above. Discrete Math is recommended. Students may satisfy this requirement with STAT 021. Students who place out of this credit should contact the Computer Science department chair. CPSC 046/MATH 046 may not be used to satisfy the Math requirement.
